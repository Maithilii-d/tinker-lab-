    <p style="color:crimson;">
Programming languages are formal systems of communication designed to give instructions to computers. They serve as the bridge between humans and machines, allowing developers to write software that computers can execute. Each programming language has its own syntax and rules, which dictate how commands and functions should be written to perform specific tasks. These languages range from very low-level, close to the hardware, to high-level languages that abstract away complex details, making it easier for humans to program.
